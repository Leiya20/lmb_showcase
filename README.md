Day One: I added html headings (h1-h6), paragraphs (p), hortionzal rule (hr) and break (br) tags.

Day Two: Added a image (img) to the website and also understand what alternate text (alt) does. I was able to add an unordered list (ul) and ordered list (ol), created a start to change the starting number. Also the last thing was added an anchor (a) tag to github. 

Day Three: Created the files contact and resume and added anchor tags to the index file. I added all the content in both of those files. I also incorportated the bold (b) and italic (i) tags.

Day Four: I created a CSS stylesheet (main.css) and link the external file to the index.html. I added a background color and change the color of two fonts. I also incorporated a class (.) and id (#) attributes.

Day Five: Adding more CSS attributes. I have added a background-color and font-size to the h1 heading. I also learned font-weight, font-family, text-align that I incorporated in the .last-heading and then border and padding went around the image.
