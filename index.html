    <p>This is a poem by Rabindranath Tagore called "Stream of life": <br/>
       The same stream of life that runs <br/>
       through my veins night and day runs <br/>
       through the world and dances in rhythmic measures. <br/>
       It is the same life that shoots in joy <br/>
       through the dust of the earth in numberless blades of grass and <br/>
       breaks into tumultuous waves of leaves and flowers.
